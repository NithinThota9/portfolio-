# HR Analytics Dashboard 📊

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project features an interactive **HR Analytics Dashboard** designed to provide data-driven insights into employee attrition, retention, and workforce demographics. By analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) and demographic trends, this dashboard helps HR departments identify patterns in employee turnover and improve retention strategies.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- **Monitor Attrition**: Track overall attrition rate, total departures, and identify high-risk departments.
- **Analyze Demographics**: Understand the workforce distribution by age, gender, and education.
- **Evaluate Satisfaction**: Assess job satisfaction ratings across different job roles to correlate with attrition.
- **Actionable Insights**: Provide a clear view of where retention efforts should be focused (e.g., specific age groups or departments like Sales).

## 📊 Dashboard Features & KPIs
The dashboard visualizes the following critical metrics:

### **Top-Level KPIs**
- **Employee Count**: Total number of employees in the dataset (43).
- **Attrition Count**: Total employees who have left (10).
- **Attrition Rate**: Percentage of employees who have left (**23%**).
- **Active Employees**: Current workforce count (33).
- **Average Age**: Mean age of employees (37 years).

### **Visualizations**
1.  **Department Wise Attrition**: A pie chart breaking down attrition by department (e.g., Sales).
2.  **No. of Employees by Age Group**: A histogram showing the distribution of employees across age bins (e.g., peaks in 34-40 age range).
3.  **Job Satisfaction Rating**: A matrix/heatmap analyzing job satisfaction scores (1-4) across different roles (Manager, Sales Executive, Sales Representative).
4.  **Education Field Wise Attrition**: Bar chart showing attrition counts based on education background (Marketing, Life Sciences).
5.  **Attrition Rate by Gender**: Comparative analysis of attrition between Male and Female employees.
6.  **Attrition Rate by Gender for Different Age Groups**: Detailed donut charts analyzing gender-based collecting attrition within specific age brackets.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Tableau / Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard design. <!-- Update based on actual tool used -->
- **Excel / SQL**: For data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Data Source**: HR Employee Attrition Dataset (e.g., IBMA HR Analytics).

## 📂 Files Included
- `HR_Analytics_Dashboard.twbx` (Tableau Workbook) or `.pbix` (Power BI File) <!-- Update based on actual file -->
- `HR_Employee_Data.csv` (Source Dataset)
- `README.md` (Project Documentation)

## 💡 Insights & Conclusions
- **High Attrition in Sales**: The Sales department shows a significant portion of the total attrition.
- **Age Group Trends**: Employees in the mid-30s age group appear to have higher representation in the workforce.
- **Satisfaction Correlation**: Analysis of job satisfaction scores can reveal if low satisfaction in roles like "Sales Representative" correlates with higher turnover.

## 🤝 How to Use
1.  Download the `.twbx` / `.pbix` file.
2.  Open in **Tableau Public / Desktop** or **Power BI Desktop**.
3.  Interact with filters (e.g., Education) to slice the data dynamically.
